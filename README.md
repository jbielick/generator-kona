## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Yeoman is an application / file / project generator with many flavors.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-kona from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-kona
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo kona
```
